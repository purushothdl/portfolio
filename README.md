## Experimental Work
Aside from structured projects, I’ve explored:
- **Live-streamed video processing**: Streaming phone footage to the web via an IP camera app and applying YOLO object detection in real time.
- **Graph RAG & Multimodal RAG**: Leveraging Neo4j for knowledge graphs and integrating images/PDFs into AI pipelines using Vertex AI.

These were self-driven learning experiences rather than full-fledged applications but strengthened my grasp of AI-driven backend systems.
